Introduction
====

This is a theme with colourful code highlight.

Why *Theme Cesno*
----

* The code highlight is **more colourful**.
  If you are the user who love light theme, and need to use colour to
  help you identify the token of the code when coding,
  this theme might help.
* It omit the `keyword` settings in the semantic token colour customisation,
  so user can get rid of greedy rules that provides every keyword
  (even something like `void`) with semantic token `keyword`.

Content
----

* **Quiet Cesno**: a theme based on builtin theme *Quiet Light*.
